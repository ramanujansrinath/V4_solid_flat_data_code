# Early Emergence of Solid Shape Coding in Natural and Deep Network Vision
This is a repository for public access of data and matlab code to generate the figures from Srinath et al, 2020. For any further requests or clarifications, please contact the corresponding author.

## Electrophysiology
The "ep" folder contains all the data collected during the single electrode electrophysiology recordings. It contains data from 169 neurons in V4 studied with 80-800 stimuli each. For each stimulus, (1) the "id" identifies the neuron, generation, lineage, and stimulus number, (2) "col" refers to the color, (3) "tex" contains information about the object surface (SPECULAR=polished, SHADE=matte, TWOD=planar), (4) "spec" contains the XML specifications of each stimulus, and (5) "resp" contains the trial-averaged response of the neuron for that stimulus. The script "ep_data_img" loads the data, and regenerates the image for a given stimulus. It uses a java executable to do so.
